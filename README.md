# The Odin Project -  Library bookshelf page
This project was made while doing The Odin Project. </br>
The page is a simple library bookshelf page where you can add books, which include data of a book - book name, author name and page count - in a card format. **Grid** and **flexbox** were used while structuring the site. The book cards use **grid** to automatically fill space when for example zooming the site. **Flex** was used to center content easily.</br><br>

## Live site

## Technologies used
**HTML** (basic elements) </br>
**CSS** (styling using **grid** and **flexbox**, colors, borders, gaps, hover-effects, responsive design)</br>
**JavaScript** (adding book-card elements, onClick-listeners, status changing (read/unread))
</br></br>

## What I learned
I used grid and flexbox together. I refreshed my memory on adding elements to the page through JavaScript after page load, and making use of JavaScript in my websites in different aspects (DOM-modifying and event-listeners in this case).
